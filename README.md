# 👋 Hi, I'm Luis Vega

### 🖥️ IT Systems Professional | Security+ | Network+ | Infrastructure | Automation

I'm an IT Support Engineer with a strong foundation in networking and security, currently transitioning into **Systems and Infrastructure Administration**.  
I hold **CompTIA Security+** and **Network+** certifications and have hands-on experience with system configuration, troubleshooting, and endpoint security.  

I'm currently expanding my skills in **Windows Server administration, PowerShell automation, and hybrid cloud systems (Azure)** — building a foundation for a Systems Administrator role focused on reliability, security, and efficiency.
